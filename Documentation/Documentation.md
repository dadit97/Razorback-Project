## Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a>

The idea is to create a dynamic model of the Sci-Fi Armoured Personnel Carrier Razorback, from the WarHammer 40,000 game series.

The model, in addiction to being remotely controlled, should be able to follow a path he was instructed to patrol, using a compass as navigation aid and a distance sensor to avoid collisions.
This is an electronic project, so, the model will be simplified to some extent, but the objective is to create something that looks pretty similar.

## Body construction <a name="Body"></a>

To build the chassis, the protection plates and the wheels I used some woodworking machines that I have access to. The dimensions have been estabilished by scaling some images knowing the total length and width of the model.

Inside the structure two pulleys were placed to reduce the speed of the main motors, these will transmit the power to the geared wheels,which were taken from an old Meccano kit. A structure to hold the motors in place has been installed in the middle of the body.

The distance sensor had to be placed on the front, so it was colsed in a proper case.

Then the turret was built creating the servomotor housing inside and creating room for the firing LEDs, the remaining of the building work were just the various decorations to make it similar to the target.
