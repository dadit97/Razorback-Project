## Introduction

The idea is to create a dynamic model of the Sci-Fi Armoured Personnel Carrier Razorback, from the WarHammer 40,000 game series.

The model, in addiction to being remotely controlled, should be able to follow a path he was instructed to patrol, using a compass as navigation aid and a distance sensor to avoid collisions.
This is an electronic project, so, the model will be simplified to some extent, but the objective is to create something that looks pretty similar.

## Body construction

To build the chassis, the protection plates and the wheels i used some woodworking machines that i have access to. The dimensions have been estabilished by scaling some images knowing the total length and width of the model.

In the structure i placed two pulleys to reduce the speed of the main motors, these will transmit the power to the geared wheel, took from an old Meccano kit.
