## Introduction

The idea is to create a dynamic model of the Sci-Fi Armoured Personnel Carrier Razorback, from the WarHammer 40,000 game series.

The model, in addiction to being remotely controlled, should be able to follow a path he was instructed to patrol, using a compass as navigation aid and a distance sensor to avoid collisions.
This is an electronic project, so, the model will be simplified to some extent, but the objective is to create something that looks pretty similar.

## Body construction

To build the chassis, the protection plates and the wheels I used some woodworking machines that I have access to. The dimensions have been estabilished by scaling some images knowing the total length and width of the model.

In the structure two pulleys were placed to reduce the speed of the main motors, these will transmit the power to the geared wheels,which were taken from an old Meccano kit. A structure to hold the motors in place has been installed in the center of the body.
