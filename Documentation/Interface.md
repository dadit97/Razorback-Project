# Control Interface

The tank will be controlled using an Android Bluetooth application, which is able to transmit various strings by buttons and switch tapping.
A textBox is also present, to send particular commands and load the path to be followed during the autonomous mode.
To get information about the status of the model there is a window where all the information broadcasted by the controller are visualized.
